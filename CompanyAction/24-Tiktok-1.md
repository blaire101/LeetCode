# Spark SQL Query for Top 10 Cities by Sales Volume for Each Day

## Table Structure
- **order_id** (Order ID)
- **city** (City)
- **order_date** (Order Date)
- **sales** (Sales Volume)

## SQL Query Execution Order
1. FROM (Select data)
2. WHERE (Filter records)
3. GROUP BY (Group and aggregate by city and order_date)
4. SELECT (Calculate window functions and generate columns such as rank)
5. Outer SELECT and ORDER BY (Filter and sort the final results)
*(Don't modify the sentences here, just repeat the pronunciation in English.)*

## Sample Data

| order_id | city      | order_date | sales |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1        | Beijing   | 2025-01-01 | 100   |
| 2        | Shanghai  | 2025-01-01 | 150   |
| 3        | Guangzhou | 2025-01-01 | 120   |
| 4        | Beijing   | 2025-01-01 | 200   |
| 5        | Shanghai  | 2025-01-01 | 100   |
| 6        | Beijing   | 2025-01-02 | 300   |
| 7        | Shanghai  | 2025-01-02 | 250   |
| 8        | Guangzhou | 2025-01-02 | 180   |
| 9        | Beijing   | 2025-01-02 | 50    |

## SQL Code

```sql
WITH aggregated AS (
  SELECT
    city,
    order_date,
    SUM(sales) AS daily_sales,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_date ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC) AS rank
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), 30)
  GROUP BY city, order_date
)

SELECT
  order_date,
  city,
  daily_sales,
  rank,
  SUM(daily_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY order_date) AS total_daily_sales,
  SUM(daily_sales) OVER (
    PARTITION BY order_date
    ORDER BY daily_sales DESC
  ) AS cumulative_total
FROM aggregated
ORDER BY order_date ASC, daily_sales DESC;
```


## Expected Output:

| order_date | city      | daily_sales | rank | total_daily_sales | cumulative_total |
|------------|-----------|-------------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| 2025-01-01 | Beijing   | 300         | 1    | 670               | 300              |
| 2025-01-01 | Shanghai  | 250         | 2    | 670               | 550              |
| 2025-01-01 | Guangzhou | 120         | 3    | 670               | 670              |
| 2025-01-02 | Beijing   | 350         | 1    | 780               | 350              |
| 2025-01-02 | Shanghai  | 250         | 2    | 780               | 600              |
| 2025-01-02 | Guangzhou | 180         | 3    | 780               | 780              |

## Summary

Whole-Partition Aggregation (no ORDER BY):
Each row displays the total sum for the partition (e.g., 670).

Cumulative Sum (with ORDER BY and window frame):
Each row shows the running total from the start of the partition up to that row.
